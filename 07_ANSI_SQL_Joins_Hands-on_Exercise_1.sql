-- Problem Statement:Write a query to display trainer_id and batch_id details in such a way that
--                   we get all possible combinations of trainer IDs and batch IDs.
-- Hint: Use Trainer_Info and Batch_Info tables.

-- Hint: Use associate_status and trainer_info tables
-- Note: Use Right Outer Join
